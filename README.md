This is Sapling Engine - a very work-in-progress 2D game engine based loosely on ECS architecture.

Currently it is powered by SFML for rendering, audio, and input (input has a wrapper) but I plan to write my own frameworks to handle this later down the line.

In addition, I plan to add networking and my own fletched out 2D physics engine.
