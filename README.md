This is Sapling Engine - a very work-in-progress 2D game engine based loosely on ECS architecture.

Recently upgraded to use Sokol and my own custom 2d sprite renderer. Input wrapper included for easy input handling. TODO: sound, text rendering, shaders, shapes.

In addition, I plan to add networking and my own fletched out 2D physics engine.
